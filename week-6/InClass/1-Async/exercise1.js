const greekGods = [
  "Aphrodite",
  "Ares",
  "Artemis",
  "Athena",
  "Poseidon",
  "Zeus",
];

// before running the code in your browser, discuss the expected order of each loop

// synchronous - loop through the array of greek gods and print the index numbers and values to the console, e.g. '1. Ares'

// asynchronous - same as before but the index and the value of the god at position 2 in array should be printed after 2 seconds. Use: setTimeout()
